# Match My Mood

## Description

Project One - A dashboard application that accepts user input about how they are feeling and creates a personalized web environment based on that input for the user.

The user can select their personalization based on how they are currently feeling, or the opposite of how they are feeling. They can also pick a mood theme based on the weather, or the time of day.

After inputing their selection, the user is presented with a dashboard in which the color, quotation, photo gallery, song selections, and featured article all relate to the chosen mood.

If the user decides they want to pick another mood, the associated link takes them back to the user input screen.
